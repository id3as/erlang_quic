# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- RFC 9312 QUIC-LB Connection ID encoding support for load balancer routing
- New `quic_lb` module with three encoding algorithms:
  - Plaintext: server_id visible in CID (no encryption)
  - Stream Cipher: AES-128-CTR encryption of server_id
  - Block Cipher: 4-round Feistel network for <16 bytes, AES-CTR for 16 bytes,
    truncated cipher for >16 bytes
- `#lb_config{}` record for LB configuration (algorithm, server_id, key, nonce_len)
- `#cid_config{}` record for CID generation configuration
- `lb_config` option in `quic_listener` to enable LB-aware CID generation
- Variable DCID length support in short header packet parsing
- LB-aware CID generation in `quic_connection` for NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames
- E2E test suite `quic_lb_e2e_SUITE` with 21 integration tests

### Fixed
- Server-side connection termination no longer closes shared listener socket:
  previously when a server connection terminated, it would close the UDP socket
  shared with the listener, breaking all subsequent connections
- Cancel delayed ACK timer in connection terminate to prevent timer messages
  to dead processes
- Session ticket table now has TTL (7 days) and size limit (10,000 entries) to
  prevent unbounded memory growth
- Listener now properly cleans up ETS tables on terminate (standalone mode only,
  pool mode tables are managed by the pool manager)
- Draining state now uses calculated `3 * PTO` timeout per RFC 9000 Section 10.2
  instead of hardcoded 3 seconds
- Pre-connection pending data queue now has size limit (1000 entries) to prevent
  memory exhaustion from slow handshakes
- Buffer contiguity calculation now has iteration limit to prevent stack overflow
  with highly fragmented receive buffers

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Multi-pool server support with ranch-style named server pools
- `quic:start_server/3` to start named server with connection pooling
- `quic:stop_server/1` to stop named server
- `quic:get_server_info/1` to get server information (pid, port, opts, started_at)
- `quic:get_server_port/1` to get server listening port
- `quic:get_server_connections/1` to get server connection PIDs
- `quic:which_servers/0` to list all running servers
- Application supervision structure (`quic_app`, `quic_sup`, `quic_server_sup`)
- ETS-based server registry (`quic_server_registry`) with process monitoring
- `pool_size` option for listener process pooling with SO_REUSEPORT
- FreeBSD CI testing workflow
- Expanded Linux CI matrix (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, OTP 26-28)

### Changed
- `quic.app.src` now includes `{mod, {quic_app, []}}` for OTP application behaviour
- Listener supervisor registers with server registry on init for restart recovery

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Stream prioritization (RFC 9218): urgency-based scheduling with 8 priority
  levels (0-7) and incremental delivery flag
- `quic:set_stream_priority/4` and `quic:get_stream_priority/2` API
- Bucket-based priority queue for O(1) stream scheduling
- Preferred address handling (RFC 9000 Section 9.6): server can advertise a
  preferred address during handshake, client validates via PATH_CHALLENGE and
  automatically migrates to validated preferred address
- `preferred_ipv4` and `preferred_ipv6` listener options for server configuration
- `#preferred_address{}` record for IPv4/IPv6 addresses, CID, and reset token
- `quic_tls:encode_preferred_address/1` and `quic_tls:decode_preferred_address/1`
- Idle timeout enforcement (RFC 9000 Section 10.1): when `idle_timeout` option
  is set, internal timer automatically closes connection after timeout with no
  activity (set to 0 to disable)
- Persistent congestion detection (RFC 9002 Section 7.6): detects prolonged packet
  loss spanning > PTO * 3 and resets cwnd to minimum window
- Frame coalescing: ACK frames are coalesced with small pending stream data
  (< 500 bytes) for more efficient packet utilization

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Packet number reconstruction per RFC 9000 Appendix A: truncated packet numbers
  are now properly reconstructed using the largest received PN, fixing decryption
  failures for large responses (>255 packets with 1-byte PN encoding)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Docker interop runner integration (client and server images)
- Session resumption interop test (`resumption`)
- 0-RTT early data interop test (`zerortt`)
- Connection migration interop test (`connectionmigration`)
- `quic:migrate/1` API for triggering active path migration
- All 10 QUIC Interop Runner test cases now pass:
  - handshake, transfer, retry, keyupdate, chacha20, multiconnect, v2,
    resumption, zerortt, connectionmigration

### Fixed
- Connection-level flow control: now properly tracks `data_received` and sends
  MAX_DATA frames when 50% of connection window is consumed (RFC 9000 Section 4.1)
- Large downloads: interop client now writes to disk incrementally (streaming)
  instead of accumulating in memory
- Server DCID initialization: server now correctly sets DCID from client's
  Initial packet SCID field, fixing short header packet alignment
- Key update HP key preservation: header protection keys are no longer rotated
  during key updates per RFC 9001 Section 6.6
- Fixed bit validation: skip padding bytes (0x00) and invalid short headers
  (fixed bit not set) in coalesced packets
- Role-based key selection in 1-RTT packet decryption

## [0.6.5] - 2026-02-19
